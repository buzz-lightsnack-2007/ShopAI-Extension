## Background
The onset of the pandemic gave rise to the popularity of online shopping. In a survey cited by Balinbin (2021) focusing on changes in consumer behavior, around 90% of Filipinos would find online shopping convenient and price-friendly. Other factors mentioned in the study included the success of online live selling and the ability to communicate with sellers through these platforms. Since most teenagers and working adults have access to mobile devices and internet, many e-commerce platforms primarily cater to this demographic through their tie-ins with social media or at least its trends.  

Unfrotunately, it seems that the purchasing-centered interface has led to dominance of fake or misleading products within these platforms. These products use clickbait titles paired with vague or non-English descriptions, resulting in an information asymmetry and preventing some customers from purchasing correctly. Worse, they are also often placed between legitimate and properly-labeled products, increasing the difficulty and possibly wasting customers’ time. This does not only apply to knockoff or "山寨" products but also on other low-quality products in general.

What if we could enhance the current system through a web extension that seamlessly integrates with the shopping websites? Introducing ShopAI, a severless solution where artificial intelligence meets online shopping platforms!
