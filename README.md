## Background
The onset of the pandemic gave rise to the popularity of online shopping. In a survey cited by Balinbin (2021) focusing on changes in consumer behavior, around 90% of Filipinos would find online shopping convenient and price-friendly. Other factors mentioned in the study included the success of online live selling and the ability to communicate with sellers through these platforms. Hence, many e-commerce platforms primarily cater to teenagers and working adults, with its users already familiar with using the internet and are comfortable using these new platforms. 

Unfortunately, there is a frequent presence of fake or misleading products within these platforms. These typically abuse the platform’s price-focused interface and use clickbait titles paired with vague or non-English descriptions, resulting in an information asymmetry and preventing some customers from purchasing correctly. This refers to "shanzhai" products that are labelled as authentic to what they are knocking off or low quality products compared against branded products. 
Worse, they are also often placed between these legitimate and adequately labeled products, increasing the difficulty and wasting customers’ time. As the friends have pointed out, the platforms also do not address the identified problem effectively. 

What if we could enhance the current system through a web extension that seamlessly integrates with the shopping websites? Artificial intelligence, specifically language learning models such as GPT, will play a significant role in this extension since it has become increasingly versatile. This is useful as they can increase clarity on specific ideas and suggest certain actions. With this, the LLM can create better descriptions of products initially labeled vaguely and provide analysis and ratings considering all customer- and seller-provided product information. When all results are displayed at the proper location, users can be warned if the product is fraudulent or urged to raise necessary skepticism.
