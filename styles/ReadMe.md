# External GUI Libraries
External GUI libraries are required to run this repository; if the window automatically closes, then perhaps you might not have included these appropriately. They are not included by default to properly provide authors' credit, and it is recommended to get the latest versions for as long as they do not break.

## Dependencies
- [ ] Materialize Web: `/external/materialize`
- [ ] Material Design Icons: `/external/fonts`
    - Make sure to download the corresponding font and install it in the same folder.
